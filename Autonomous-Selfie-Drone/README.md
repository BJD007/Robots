# Autonomous-Selfie-Drone
A
utopilot Integration: The autopilot.py file handles the connection to the Pixhawk autopilot, arming, takeoff, navigation, and landing.
Video Streaming: The video_stream.py file handles live video feed and recording using OpenCV.
User Application: The user_app.py file provides a simple GUI for user commands using Tkinter.
Follow-Me Capability: The follow_me.py file implements the follow-me functionality.
Obstacle Detection: The obstacle_detection.py file handles obstacle detection and collision avoidance.
Autonomous Charging: The charging.py file implements autonomous charging logic.
Live 3D Mapping: The mapping.py file collects depth data and visual data to create a 3D map.
Configuration: The config.py file contains configuration settings.
This implementation provides a basic structure for an autonomous selfie drone with the specified features. Each module needs to be further developed and tested. Additionally, you will need to ensure that all hardware components are properly connected and configured. Always follow safety guidelines and regulations when operating drones.
