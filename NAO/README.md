# NAO

## This code creates a TherapySession class with methods for each therapy exercise:

- turn_taking_game(): A simple color-naming game to practice turn-taking.
- eye_contact_exercise(): Uses face detection to encourage and reinforce eye contact.
- imitation_game(): NAO performs actions and encourages the user to imitate them.

## To use this code:
- Make sure you have the NAOqi Python SDK installed and properly set up.
- Replace the IP variable with your NAO robot's IP address.
- Ensure that the required behaviors (like "animations/raise_arm") are available on your NAO robot.

This code provides a basic structure for a robot-assisted therapy session. 

## In a real therapy setting, you would likely need to:
- Customize the exercises based on the specific needs of the patient.
- Add more complex interactions and behaviors.
- Implement error handling and safety measures.
- Include logging and data collection for tracking progress.
- Adjust timings and complexity based on the patient's age and abilities.

Remember that this code is a starting point and should be adapted and expanded upon with the guidance of healthcare professionals to ensure it meets the specific therapeutic needs of the patients.
