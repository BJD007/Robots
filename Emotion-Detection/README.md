# Emotion-Detection

## A high-level overview of the system architecture and sample code snippets for each sensory component. 
- This is a simplified representation and would require significant refinement and integration for a real-world application.
- System Architecture
- Vision System
- Speech Recognition System
- Olfactory System (based on snake olfactory senses)
- EEG (Brain Wave) Detection System
- Emotion Detection System (integrating data from all sensors)

This code provides a basic framework for a robot with multiple sensory systems capable of detecting human emotions. 

It includes simulated components for olfactory and EEG systems, which would require specialized hardware in a real implementation. The emotion detection algorithm is greatly simplified and would need to be much more sophisticated in a real-world application.

To implement this system, you would need to install the necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow, SpeechRecognition) and have the appropriate hardware (camera, microphone, and specialized sensors for olfactory and EEG detection). The integration of these components and the development of a robust emotion detection algorithm would require significant additional work and expertise in machine learning and robotics.
