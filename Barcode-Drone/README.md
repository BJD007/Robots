# Barcode-Drone


Autonomous indoor navigation drone that uses Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for positioning, PX4Flow for optical flow-based navigation, and barcode detection. This drone will be based on the PX4 autopilot system and use a Raspberry Pi for high-level control and image processing.
Here's the project structure:
main.py - Main execution script
autopilot.py - Autopilot and navigation functions
uwb_positioning.py - UWB positioning system
optical_flow.py - PX4Flow optical flow processing
barcode_detector.py - Barcode detection using computer vision
mission_planner.py - Mission planning and execution
config.py - Configuration settings


This code provides a basic structure for an autonomous indoor navigation drone using UWB, PX4Flow, and barcode detection. It needs to be adapted to your specific hardware and requirements.
The Autopilot class uses pymavlink to communicate with the PX4 flight controller. Make sure to install this library.
The UWB and PX4Flow classes assume serial communication. You may need to adjust these based on your specific hardware setup.
The BarcodeDetector class uses OpenCV and the pyzbar library for barcode detection. Install these libraries if you haven't already.
The MissionPlanner class provides a simple waypoint-based mission. You can expand this to include more complex behaviors.
Ensure all necessary libraries are installed:
text
pip install pymavlink pyserial opencv-python pyzbar

This code is a starting point and will require testing and refinement. Always prioritize safety when working with drones, especially in indoor environments.
Make sure to calibrate your sensors and test each component individually before attempting a full autonomous mission.

To integrate barcode detection with PX4 flight control software, you can follow these steps:
Set up a companion computer:
Use a small single-board computer like a Raspberry Pi alongside the PX4 flight controller. This companion computer will handle the barcode detection processing.
Connect the companion computer to PX4:
Connect the Raspberry Pi to the PX4 flight controller using a UART serial connection. This allows communication between the two systems.
Install necessary software on the companion computer:
Set up ROS (Robot Operating System) on the Raspberry Pi
Install OpenCV for image processing
Install a barcode detection library like ZBar or pyzbar
Implement barcode detection:
Write a Python script on the Raspberry Pi that:
Captures images from a camera
Uses OpenCV and the barcode library to detect and decode barcodes
Publishes detected barcode data to a ROS topic
Integrate with PX4:
Use MAVROS to bridge communication between ROS and PX4
Subscribe to the barcode detection ROS topic in your flight control code
Use the detected barcode data to influence flight behavior or mission planning
Update PX4 firmware:
Modify the PX4 firmware to incorporate barcode detection results into its decision-making process. This may involve creating custom mavlink messages to communicate barcode data.
Test and refine:
Thoroughly test the integrated system, ensuring reliable barcode detection and appropriate drone responses.
Remember to follow best practices for drone development and testing. Always prioritize safety when working with autonomous systems.
