## Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a fleet of three multi-agent autonomous drones capable of working collaboratively in various tasks, such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics. The system will demonstrate intelligent navigation, real-time communication, and coordinated decision-making.

### Key Features:

- **Autonomous Navigation:** Real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance.
- **Multi-Agent Communication:** Seamless communication and data sharing between drones.
- **Cooperative Task Execution:** Coordinated decision-making for collaborative tasks.
- **Real-time Data Processing:** Onboard data processing and analysis for immediate decision-making.
- **User Interface:** Monitoring and control through a web-based interface.

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following components:

- **Drones:** Each drone is equipped with sensors, cameras, communication modules, and onboard computing power.
- **Control Station:** A central unit for monitoring drone operations and providing high-level commands.
- **Cloud Services:** Optional cloud integration for data storage and advanced processing.
- **Communication Network:** A reliable network for communication between drones and the control station.

### Hardware Requirements

- **Drone Models:** DJI Phantom 4 or similar models with open SDK support.
- **Sensors:** GPS, IMU, LiDAR, and Cameras for obstacle detection and navigation.
- **Communication Modules:** WiFi or RF modules for real-time communication.
- **Computing Power:** Onboard computers like Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

## Software Modules

The software architecture includes several modules responsible for various tasks within the system. Each module is designed to be modular and extensible.

### 1. Navigation System

The navigation system handles path planning, obstacle avoidance, and flight control. This system enables the drones to autonomously navigate in complex environments.

#### Path Planning

We'll use the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm for path planning. This algorithm efficiently finds a path from the start to the goal position, considering obstacles.

#### Obstacle Avoidance

The drones will use LiDAR sensors to detect obstacles and dynamically adjust their path. We'll employ a simple potential field method for obstacle avoidance.

### 2. Communication System

The communication system enables real-time data exchange between drones and the control station. This module ensures seamless coordination and information sharing among the drones.

#### Communication Protocol

We'll use a lightweight communication protocol based on MQTT for efficient data exchange.

### 3. Coordination System

The coordination system handles task allocation and decision-making among drones, ensuring collaborative execution.

#### Task Allocation

We use a Contract Net Protocol (CNP) for dynamic task allocation among drones. This protocol allows drones to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and availability.

### 4. Data Processing and Analysis

This module handles data processing and analysis for tasks such as environmental monitoring and logistics.

#### Environmental Monitoring

The drones collect environmental data and analyze it in real-time for decision-making.

### 5. User Interface

The user interface allows monitoring and control of the drone fleet. A web-based dashboard provides real-time information and control capabilities.

## Deployment and Testing

### Deployment

- **Hardware Setup:** Install sensors and communication modules on the drones.
- **Software Installation:** Deploy the software modules on the drones' onboard computers.
- **Communication Network:** Establish a reliable communication network for data exchange.

### Testing

- **Unit Testing:** Validate each software module individually.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure seamless integration of all modules.
- **Field Testing:** Conduct real-world tests to evaluate system performance.
