# RFID-Drone

An autonomous indoor navigation drone that uses Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for positioning, PX4Flow for optical flow-based navigation, and RFID detection. This drone will be based on the PX4 autopilot system and use a Raspberry Pi for high-level control and RFID processing.
Here's the project structure:
main.py - Main execution script
autopilot.py - Autopilot and navigation functions
uwb_positioning.py - UWB positioning system
optical_flow.py - PX4Flow optical flow processing
rfid_detector.py - RFID detection and processing
mission_planner.py - Mission planning and execution
config.py - Configuration settings

This code provides a basic structure for an autonomous indoor navigation drone using UWB, PX4Flow, and RFID detection. It needs to be adapted to your specific hardware and requirements.
The Autopilot class uses pymavlink to communicate with the PX4 flight controller. Make sure to install this library.
The UWB, PX4Flow, and RFID classes assume serial communication. You may need to adjust these based on your specific hardware setup.
The RFIDDetector class assumes a simple serial RFID reader. You may need to modify this based on your specific RFID hardware.
The MissionPlanner class provides a simple waypoint-based mission. You can expand this to include more complex behaviors, especially in response to RFID detections.
Ensure all necessary libraries are installed:
text
pip install pymavlink pyserial

This code is a starting point and will require testing and refinement. Always prioritize safety when working with drones, especially in indoor environments.
Make sure to calibrate your sensors and test each component individually before attempting a full autonomous mission.
The RFID detection is integrated into the main loop, and the handle_rfid_detection method in MissionPlanner is called when an RFID is detected. You can implement custom behavior in this method based on the detected RFID tags.
Remember to adjust the serial port names in the config.py file to match your actual hardware setup.
