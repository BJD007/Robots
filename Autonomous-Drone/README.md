# Autonomous-Drone

Below is a high-level outline of how you can structure the code for such a drone. This will include the main functionalities like autonomous flight, live video feed, follow-me capability, obstacle detection, and more.

## Project Structure
- main.py - Main execution script
- autopilot.py - Autopilot-related functions
- video_stream.py - Live video feed and recording
- user_app.py - Cross-platform user application
- follow_me.py - Follow-me capability
- obstacle_detection.py - Obstacle detection and collision avoidance
- charging.py - Autonomous charging capability
- mapping.py - Live 3D mapping
- config.py - Configuration settings

## Files description
- Autopilot Integration: The autopilot.py file handles the connection to the Pixhawk autopilot, arming, takeoff, navigation, and landing.
- Video Streaming: The video_stream.py file handles live video feed and recording using OpenCV.
- User Application: The user_app.py file provides a simple GUI for user commands using Tkinter.
- Follow-Me Capability: The follow_me.py file implements the follow-me functionality.
- Obstacle Detection: The obstacle_detection.py file handles obstacle detection and collision avoidance.
- Autonomous Charging: The charging.py file implements autonomous charging logic.
- Live 3D Mapping: The mapping.py file is a placeholder for live 3D mapping logic.
- Configuration: The config.py file contains configuration settings.

This is a high-level implementation and serves as a starting point. Each module needs to be further developed and tested. Additionally, you will need to ensure that all hardware components are properly connected and configured. Always follow safety guidelines and regulations when operating drones.
