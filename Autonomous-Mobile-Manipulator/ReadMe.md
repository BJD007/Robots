1. Software Development in ROS and C++
1.1 Set Up ROS Environment

    Install ROS: Follow the ROS installation guide for your operating system.
    Create a ROS Workspace:

    bash
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash

Create ROS Packages:

bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_create_pkg robot_control std_msgs rospy roscpp
catkin_create_pkg sensor_processing sensor_msgs rospy roscpp
catkin_create_pkg motion_planning geometry_msgs rospy roscpp

1.2 Develop C++ Nodes
Sensor Data Processing Node

    File: perception_node.cpp

Motion Planning Node

    File: src/motion_planning/src/navigation_node.cpp

2. Integration of Perception, Manipulation, and Navigation
2.1 Perception Algorithms

    Use OpenCV and PCL libraries for image and point cloud processing.
    Implement object detection using YOLO or similar models.

2.2 Manipulation Algorithms

    Develop inverse kinematics for the robotic arm using libraries like MoveIt!.

2.3 Navigation Algorithms

    Implement path planning using ROS Navigation Stack.
    Use algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s or A* for obstacle avoidance.

3. Behavior Tree Framework
3.1 Design Behavior Tree

    File: src/behavior_tree/src/behavior_tree_node.cpp
3.2 Test and Refine

    Simulate dynamic environments using Gazebo.
    Adjust behavior tree based on sensor feedback and task priorities.

4. Use Case Development
4.1 Identify and Implement Use Cases

    Common Tasks: Object retrieval, cleaning, etc.
    Develop specific nodes or scripts for each task.
    Test in simulation and real-world scenarios to ensure reliability.

This project involves a combination of software development, algorithm implementation, and testing in simulated environments. Each component should be thoroughly tested and integrated to achieve the desired autonomous behavior.
