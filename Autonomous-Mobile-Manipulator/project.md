## Project: Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Development
### Objective: Develop a prototype of an autonomous mobile manipulator robot that can navigate and perform tasks in a simulated domestic environment, integrating perception, manipulation, and navigation capabilities using ROS and C++.

### Key Components of the Project:

### Software Development in ROS and C++:
    Objective: Gain hands-on experience with ROS and C++ by developing software modules for the robot.
    Tasks:
        - Set up a ROS environment and create packages for different robot functionalities.
        - Develop C++ nodes for sensor data processing, motion planning, and control.
   
### Integration of Perception, Manipulation, and Navigation:
    Objective: Integrate different robotic functions to create cohesive robot behaviors.
    Tasks:
        - Implement perception algorithms using sensors like LiDAR and cameras for environment mapping and object detection.
        - Develop manipulation algorithms for a robotic arm to interact with objects.
        - Implement navigation algorithms for path planning and obstacle avoidance.
   
### Behavior Tree Framework:
    Objective: Design and implement a behavior tree framework to orchestrate robot actions.
    Tasks:
        - Create a behavior tree structure to manage task execution based on sensor inputs and task priorities.
        - Test and refine the behavior tree to ensure robust operation in dynamic environments.
    
### Use Case Development:
    Objective: Develop specific use cases for the robot based on potential customer requirements.
    Tasks:
        - Identify common tasks in domestic environments, such as object retrieval or cleaning.
        - Implement and test these use cases, ensuring the robot can perform them reliably.
    
### Troubleshooting and Optimization:
    Objective: Enhance problem-solving skills by identifying and resolving software and hardware issues.
    Tasks:
        - Use debugging tools to troubleshoot software issues.
        - Optimize code for performance and reliability.
    
### Documentation and Communication:
    Objective: Develop clear documentation and improve communication skills.
    Tasks:
        - Document the development process, including software architecture and testing results.
        - Prepare a presentation to explain the project and its outcomes, simulating a real-world scenario of communicating with team members and stakeholders.
