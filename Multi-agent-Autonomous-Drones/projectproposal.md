# Multi-Agent Autonomous Drones Project Proposal

## Introduction

This proposal outlines a project plan for developing and demonstrating a Multi-Agent Autonomous Drones System (MAADS). The project aims to create a coordinated fleet of at least three autonomous drones capable of performing tasks collaboratively and demonstrating their capabilities to the public and stakeholders. The demonstration will showcase the drones' ability to work in various applications, including search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics.

## Proposed Deliverables

### Multi-Agent Autonomous Drones System (MAADS)

The MAADS will consist of three drones designed for cooperative operation. The system will demonstrate the following capabilities:

1. **Collaborative Search and Rescue:** The drones will perform a simulated search and rescue operation, showcasing their ability to cover large areas, locate objects or individuals, and relay information back to a central command unit. This will demonstrate the potential use of MAADS in disaster management and emergency response.

2. **Environmental Monitoring:** The drones will conduct an environmental monitoring demonstration, highlighting their ability to collect data on air quality, temperature, humidity, and other parameters. This showcases the potential for environmental monitoring in agriculture, forestry, and pollution control.

3. **Logistics and Delivery:** The drones will simulate a logistics and delivery task, demonstrating their ability to transport goods between locations autonomously. This will illustrate the potential application of MAADS in the logistics and e-commerce industries.

### Public Demonstrations

The project will include a series of public demonstrations to highlight the capabilities of the MAADS. These demonstrations will be held at local tech events, educational institutions, and industry conferences, providing an opportunity for stakeholders to witness the system's capabilities firsthand.

## Project Plan and Timeline

The project will be divided into the following phases:

### Phase 1: Research and Development (Months 1-3)
